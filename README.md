# Physics Simulator

This app is a 2D physics mechanics simulator. Its purpose is to show the various properties of objects in space, and their collisions with lines or other spheres.
Currently the only objects used are spheres. I am looking forward to improve my applied algorightmic skills to introduce regular polygons, and if possible to my abilities, convex hulls drawn by user.

Feel free to explore, I will provide documentation for my classes and methods.

I am using the Raylib framework, along with Raymath for cleaner code.
